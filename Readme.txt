Automation has become a key term in recent years. The term refers to the completion of any given task automatically without any need of continuous human intervention or management. Many tasks of our daily life are now automated. A section of automation is widely used in security purposes. For example, we can mention the use of Facial recognition systems, and Number plate recognition systems. All of these use the basic idea of object detection algorithms behind the scenes. For every different sort of task that are similar to this, the system will first try and detect objects, but the basic difference would be the specific target parameters that will be passed to the system. In this project, we will be looking into the methods of object detection within still images. We will be using Python programming language to fulfil this task. As the Imaging & Special Effects module give us the necessary basic ideas that we need to make this happen, this is a project to build a better understanding of the concepts and to ensure that we will be able to use this knowledge in the future on more pressing problems and important projects.

To provide the recognition of objects in a particular context, which to some extend similar to the one on humans, automated system needs to go through a number of processes. Technique such as image collecting, pre-processing, and more needs to be applied to achieve said goal. However, image processing comes with its own set of challenges that will be covered in this documentation. Imaging and Special Effect module is aimed to give high-level understanding on the technique and practical implementation to overcome these challenges. This assignment, specifically, has a goal to come up with a system which can detect, explore, and determine the scene given using digital image processing technique. The system is expected to give and accurate description of the scene with plausible information.
